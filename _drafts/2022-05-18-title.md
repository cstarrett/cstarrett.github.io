You won't succeed if you don't try. Yes, it's a truism, but that doesn't make it any less true.

Equally true is that you can't avoid failure if you want to succeed.

When doing anything new, anything worth doing, you will inevitably fail along the way. Probably many times. Or in the words of Jason Mraz, you'll "win some and learn some."

The only way to avoid failure is not to try. And if you don't try, you'll never succeed.

It's not "success *or* failure," but "success *and* failure." It's a package deal.
