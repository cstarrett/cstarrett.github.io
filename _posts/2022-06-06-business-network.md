The key part of any business isn't the business plan, or the product, or the balance sheet, or the organizational structure.

It's the people. All of them.

The people who imagine and design the product. The people who make the product. The people who market it. The people who sell it. The people who buy it. The people who ship it. The people who appreciate it and talk about it. The people who balance the books. The people who make hiring decisions and firing decisions. The people who maintain the equipment. And many, many more.

The people who care for each other, for the customer, and for the planet enough to commit themselves to make things better by making better things.

So, if a business is made up of people, how strong are the connections between them? What is the condition of the relationships that make up the human network which keeps information and action flowing freely inside and outside your business?

And how much of your time, attention, and energy is focused on the people of your business? What would happen without them?
