As Seth Godin writes, [constraints are a gift](https://seths.blog/2022/09/constraints-are-a-gift/). 

In addition to the reasons Seth gives, constraints also help us to focus our efforts on what we can do, rather than wasting time on things beyond our control.

After all, we can only do one thing at a time anyway. So isn't it a gift when our choices are narrowed down for us by constraints?
