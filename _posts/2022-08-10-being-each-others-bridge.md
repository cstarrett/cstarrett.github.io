No one is an island, as the saying goes, but sometimes we feel alone. This can be for many reasons. Experiencing rejection in a relationship or a job. Frustration with repeated personal failure or not being able to reach a goal. Maybe it's simply the accumulation of anxiety and social isolation that is making us feel alone.

There can be many reasons, but once we close up, shut down, and settle into our loneliness, it's extremely difficult to reconnect to other people. In those moments, we need somebody to step into our loneliness from the outside, and be a bridge. To reawaken the feeling of connectedness in us and remind us that we are part of a larger whole of humanity.

In most cases, being a bridge doesn't require any special skills or degrees. All we need is the ability to care and to feel compassion. To connect to that part of us that sometimes feels isolated and alone, and reach out to the person who is suffering in that moment. To say, "It's okay. We all feel alone sometimes. I'm here for you."

All of us have the ability to be a bridge back to humanity for each other. All we need is to be aware, to reach out, and to be there.
