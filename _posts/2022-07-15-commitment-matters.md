Have you ever committed to do something but found it difficult to follow through? What did you feel as you struggled with commitment? Guilt for not keeping your word? Shame that you couldn't do the thing that you thought was important to you? Maybe some deeper feelings of incompetence or lacking?

The challenge with commitment is that we often commit to things based on what we *think* we want, but true commitment only comes from deep *caring* about what we're committing to. And in a society which sends us messages all the time telling us what we *should* care about, we can lose touch with the signals inside of us that are telling us what we *really* care about.

It takes practice and dedication to sense and feel those signals. To notice what our bodies and emotions are drawing us towards, or steering us away from. And ironically, it takes commitment to strengthen our ability to sense and feel those signals, so we can know what we are truly wanting, and able, to commit to.

What would life look like if we were better able to sense and feel what really matters to us, and could live in alignment with *that,* rather than living lives according to what we are told *should* matter to us?
