Sometimes willpower is what we need to succeed, like when training for a marathon or studying for an exam.

But when we're in uncharted waters, especially when doing inner leadership work in yourself or your team, then powering through with your will is a bad idea.

What you need is new skills, and to grow the capacity to use those skills. 

What you need is patience and compassion to fail, learn, and fail again as you develop new competencies.

So it's important to ask yourself, does this challenge need me to bring more will, or more skills.
