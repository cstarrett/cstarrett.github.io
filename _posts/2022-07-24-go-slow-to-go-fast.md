My life and work partner, [Jung](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jungstarrett/), has been advising people for over a decade to "go slow to go fast," but what does that mean?

This is more than just "measure twice and cut once" â€” or avoiding mistakes by not rushing. Going slow means taking time to ask questions.

Taking time to look at what I think I know about a situation and asking, "Is that true?" 

Pausing to take a deep breath and notice whether I'm reacting out of a thought or emotion, or if I'm taking a truly intentional action that's aligned with what's most important right now.

Creating time for my team to come together and refresh our sense of shared intention so our individual decisions and actions are moving us in the same direction.

Taking the time to skillfully navigate the road will get us to our destination sooner, rather than speeding headlong into a ditch because we missed an important sign along the way.
