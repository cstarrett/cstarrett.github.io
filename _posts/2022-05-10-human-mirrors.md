The person who is the hardest for us to see objectively is ourselves.

We know too much of our own history, and we will tend to underestimate or overestimate ourselves more than anyone else. That's why we need each other.

If I can see you clearly, and you can see me clearly, then we can help each other.

And the more mirrors the better. Each person brings a lens, a perspective, a way of seeing which is different from others.

So the more we can gather together and reflect back to each other, the more clearly we will be able see the truth about ourselves.

And from that clearer awareness comes better decisions and action.
