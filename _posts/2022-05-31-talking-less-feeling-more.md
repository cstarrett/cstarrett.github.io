In the United States our epidemic of mass shootings is getting worse, and we're more divided than ever over what to do about it.

This is only made worse by our increasing inability to agree on facts, and our unwillingness to consider that our facts — the foundation of our reasoning — might be wrong.

Maybe it's time to stop trying to argue the facts, and start feeling the pain and grief of these deaths together. Maybe the more productive and healthy choice for all of us would be to stop trying to solve this problem by arguing about it, and instead, to help each other to process all of these deaths regardless of our political opinion.

Whatever we may think about guns, we can come together as one human family around our shared grief for the lives that are being cut short by violence. And maybe if we can feel the grief together as one, a more sane path forward will emerge from us together. One we can all agree upon and move into action as one human family.
