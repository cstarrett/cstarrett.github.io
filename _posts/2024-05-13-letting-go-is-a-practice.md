title: Letting go is a practice

It's hard to let go of what we can't change.

Mistakes or missteps in the past. Worries about the future. People who seem like they don't even want to listen.

These are just a few things that the mind can get caught on. Get hooked on. Get our thoughts circling around and around.

This is why letting go is a practice. When we aspire to let go of what (and who) we can't change, we make a commitment to practice letting go. So that when we notice our mind is snagged, we stop. We take a moment to breathe, calm the body, and smile at what our mind is snagged on. "Hello. I see you. You can stay, but I'm going to move on." We smile, and we release.

Stop
Smile
Greet
Release

Wash, Rinse, Repeat

And because it's a practice, it doesn't matter how many times we get hooked over and over again. Each time is another opportunity to practice stopping, smiling, and letting go.
