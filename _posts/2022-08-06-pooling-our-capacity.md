title:  "Pooling our capacity"

Each of us can only handle so much.

So much anxiety. So much stress. So much frustration. So much pressure.

When we get together to complain, it feels a little better in the moment. We can each let some steam out of our own pot full of challenges and reduce the pressure for a bit. But before long, the pressure builds back up again.

A more lasting solution is to pool our capacity together. To create a safe enough space where we can slow down and share what we each see, feel, and sense in a way that creates a large, shared cauldron. A single pot that can contain all of our experiences and that lets each of us see a bigger picture â€” a picture that we each contribute to.

And when we get together regularly, and keep the cauldron going, then we don't have to be limited to the size of our own little pot anymore. We can call on the spaciousness and openness of the cauldron whenever we need to.

This world is too much for any one of us to handle. But together, not only can we handle it, we can use what we see, sense and feel in our shared cauldron to create a world that supports the well-being of all.
