There is no negotiating with an organization, or dealing with an organization, or working with an organization.

It's always people. People with names. People with friends and family. People with histories, likes, dislikes, personalities, moods, and emotions.

When we don't see the people in an organization as people and try to relate to them as a function or role in the organization, we may find that we are treated like a role, too. A prospect, or salesman, or even a mark. Not a person with a name.

If we can relate directly to each other as people, not roles, and remember each others' human-ness, then we have the opportunity to bring more human-ness into business.

Maybe, all we need to make business more human, is for two people to make a choice to see each other as fellow human beings, moment-to-moment.
