"It's not over 'till it's over."

This may be a truism, but most of us humans forget this truth in the moment.

In the moment of the big failure, we feel like our career, business, or lives are over, even though we have no idea of where this failure might lead us. We have no idea what will happen next in our lives.

In the moment of the big success, we may think that we finally made it, even though we have no idea where this success might lead us, and what will happen next.

That's not to say that we shouldn't feel disappointed with failure, or feel happy about success. It's important to feel what we feel, but beware the thoughts that come, telling us where this failure or success will lead.

Because the hard truth is, we have no idea what the future holds.

The best we can do is to do what we can with what we have, right in this moment.
