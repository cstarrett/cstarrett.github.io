Profound human tragedy is hard for us to see. We can be tempted to look away. And sometimes for self care we need to.

But action requires awareness, and the shared action required to respond to human tragedy requires shared awareness. We need to look together and feel the pain together, in order for a shared intention to arise. An intention to make sure we do whatever we can to make sure this doesn't happen again.

Only by looking each other in the eye and feeling each others' pain together, will we have a chance of working together to make a difference.

And it takes courage, capacity, and the commitment to create a world the supports the well-being of all.
