Often when we get into a conflict, we can be tempted to react right away. The problem is, in the heat of the moment, we rarely understand completely what happened. We don't have all the information we need to respond wisely.

Part of the problem is that there are often facts that we don't want to admit to ourselves. Things about the conflict which trigger anger or fear and which we don't want to look at directly. And thus we ignore this key information.

Taking the time to feel something fully is taking the time to get to know the situation more â€” including the parts that are uncomfortable to look at.

Taking the time to feel what we don't want to feel can help us to get more of the facts before we act.
