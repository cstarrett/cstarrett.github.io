There can be many reasons why a project or initiative fails.

You ran out of time or money. Essential skills were lacking. It didn't gather a critical mass of support. There was poor communication inside or outside the team. And the list goes on.

The thing is, most reasons for failure are solvable, if there is the will to solve them. Which is why the central reason a project or initiative fails is lack of commitment to a shared intention.

If everyone on a team agrees that the work matters and wants it to succeed because it connects to their own values in a meaningful way, then there will always be a way to continue to make some progress, even if it's small.

A way to create quick, inexpensive prototypes to learn from. A way to barter for necessary skills. A way to spread the word drip-by-drip. A way to debrief communication breakdowns with honesty and vulnerability and make the changes that need to be made.

Where there is a will, there is a way. It may not be the way that you hoped for, but there is a way.

The question is whether there is enough commitment to a shared intention to find that way.
