How many connections do you have on LinkedIn? Are they few enough to be numbered, or have you broken the "500+" barrier?

The truth is, we all have more connections than we could possibly count. Every human on the planet is connected to each other, however distantly. We are connected through acquaintance, through commerce, through the air we breathe, through common genetic coding, through threads that are too many to be numbered.

Our challenge is not that we live in a disconnected world. Our challenge is that we forget how connected we are. The invitation is not to connect, but to remember our interconnectedness, and to practice acting on our interconnectedness.

To remember that our actions affect the people around us, people around the globe, and the Earth itself.

To remember that our thoughts influence our perception of ourselves, our perception of others, and our perception of the world around us.

To remember that it is up to us to choose to practice thinking, seeing, and acting with an intention to propagate well-being throughout the web of connection.

We are connected. What will you send out on the web today?
