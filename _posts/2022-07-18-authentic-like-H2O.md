Being true to who you are doesn't mean that you behave the same way with your kids the way you do in the board room. And it certainly doesn't mean acting however you feel in the moment.

Being true to who you are means you stay true to your values whether anyone is watching you or not, whether other people will approve or not, and whether you feel like it or not.

How you *express* those values, however, will depend on the context. If kindness is one of your key values, being kind to your children is different from being kind to a venture capitalist which is different from being kind to an employee who you need to fire.

Ice, tap water, steam, and clouds all have the same chemical makeup. They are all H20, expressing itself differently depending on the context.

What do you notice about how you show up in different contexts? When are you able to easily stay true to yourself, and when is it more difficult?
