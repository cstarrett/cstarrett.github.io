When we don't know what to do, we often make a critical mistake.

We think the problem is that we don't know which choice is best, or maybe we even think that all the choices are equally bad.

But when we feel stuck it's often because we're not seeing the whole picture. We're not seeing all the possibilities. We only see a few.

The best way to see more possibilities is to get help. If I ask a trusted partner or three to sit together and sense into the challenge I'm facing, it gives me the chance to to borrow their senses and to widen my perception.

The trick is to ask that they *not* give advice, or try to fix the problem. Their job is to be my extra eyes and ears so we all see, feel, and sense more together, than I could alone.

Once I get a broader, higher-resolution picture of the situation, I'll often know what to do.

If I know what's possible, then I know what the best choice is for me to take. But that's a big *if*. What I often lack is the awareness of all the choices that are available to me. That's where I need help â€” to see, feel, and sense the whole. Together.
