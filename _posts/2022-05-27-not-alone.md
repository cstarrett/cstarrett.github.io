Much of business culture still focuses on individual success. It rewards the superstar and promotes the highest achievers to higher-and-higher levels of leadership.

Which doesn't really make sense, when you think about it.

Leaders need to excel at collaboration. They need to understand the social psychology of groups and how a team can be most creative and effective â€” together.

Phenomenal individual contributors make for great stories, but they don't necessarily know anything about working together.

The success of an organization is much more dependent on its employees' competence with real skills, than it is on the technical excellence of a superstar. And the stronger our real skills for working together, the stronger the organization.

With all due respect to Batman, humans are not meant to work alone. It's long past time that our education system, and corporate training programs, spent more time focused on the real skills of working together, and less time on creating lone wolves.
