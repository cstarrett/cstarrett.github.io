There's lots of advice for how to set ourselves up for success by creating the right conditions. Writers are advised to get up early to get their writing in before the day begins. Runners, too. Meditators are told to create a dedicated space for practice in their homes. Dieters are taught to calculate and control the caloric content of each meal, so they can reach their desired weight.

Controlling our environment to creating certain conditions around us may be effective for some of us some of the time, but how about creating conditions for success and well-being inside ourselves?

What if we could create the conditions inside to be able to focus on writing whenever we had time, or to take a moment to focus on the breath before starting a meeting, or to practice walking meditation between the car and the front door, or to bring our full attention to each bite of a meal and deeply appreciate what we're eating?

There's nothing wrong with trying to create a supportive environment, but trying to control the outside world is a lot more stressful than pleasure of paying attention to ourselves and creating conditions inside us to work with whatever comes.

Learning to create the conditions that will support us inside, regardless of what the conditions are outside, is a free and portable superpower available to anyone willing to practice.
