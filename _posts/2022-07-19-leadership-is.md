Leadership is taking the risk of going first.

Leadership is allowing someone new to set the direction.

Leadership is making change with intention.

Leadership is daring to say, "I don't know."

Leadership is giving credit where credit is due.

Leadership is keeping an open mind and an open heart.

Leadership is standing up for what is non-negotiable.

Leadership is listening, and being willing to say what needs to be said.

Leadership is never forgetting that we all need each other to lead.
