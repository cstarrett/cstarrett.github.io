Reading the news it seems like the world is just getting worse and worse. From war to shootings to climate crises to human rights being taken awayâ€¦

Not to mention whatever personal struggles we are each going through.

Is it possible to feel joy with everything that seems to be going wrong? Is it even okay to feel happy despite all of this?

It's more than okay. It's required. For those of us in the business of creating change for the well-being of all, it is our job, as professionals, to practice gratitude and joy every day. Noticing acts of kindness, witnessing the resilience of nature, feeling the parts of our bodies which support us in going about our day.

We develop our own inner capability and capacity for joy and the en*joy*ment of everyday living to deepen our connection to life. And we grow our caring for life so that we can stand up for what matters and do what we can to make things better for all of life.

It can be easy to get pulled into hopelessness and despair by present problems, but it is when things look the worst, that we need to practice joy the most. It's joy that keeps us going now so we can do our part to co-create a better future.
