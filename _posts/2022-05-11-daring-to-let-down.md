It’s easy to shut down a project or business, or to end a relationship when everyone agrees that things aren’t going well. When it’s draining everyone’s resources without enough benefit.

It’s more difficult when some people are benefitting, but you aren't.

Maybe it’s taking up too much time or emotional labor. Maybe you’ve learned everything you can and you find yourself just going through the motions. Or maybe you’re feeling pulled in a new direction and the only way to let something new come in to your work and life is to let go of the old.

When you know that your letting go is going to let people down, it can feel like you’re stealing, or even causing harm. This is a very uncomfortable feeling, but a necessary discomfort that we need to feel in order to let go of things that no longer serve us, even when they appear to be still serving other people.

The alternative is to deny ourselves and refuse new possibilities. Inevitably, this path will lead to the same end as letting go of the project, the business or the relationship, but it will take much longer and be much more painful in the long run.

So the question is: do you have the courage to endure the discomfort of letting people down now with gratitude for the past and excitement for as possible future, or will you hang on through a long, slow decline into resentment and apathy?
