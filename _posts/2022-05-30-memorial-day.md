Today is Memorial Day in the U.S.. A day of remembrance.

On this Memorial Day I feel a yearning to re-member our social body â€” to reconnect the parts that have been separated by anger, fear, aggression, and unnecessary death. To recognize and remind ourselves that we are connected to each other as humans, and we are all a part of nature as mammals.

I feel a yearning to re-member my own body which feels disconnected from others because of my own anger, fear, and aggression. To recognize and remind myself of my responsibility and my agency in the re-membering of our social body.

I welcome the sadness that speaks to me of the loss that matters to me. And I welcome the joy of having had something and someone worth losing.
