I remember hearing this expression about being dead inside. And somehow I never recognized that it was describing me.

I had become so good at putting on a happy face, that I didn't realize I was dead inside.
I had become so good at doing what others wanted me to do, that I didn't realize I was dead inside.
I had become so good at pretending that my constant restlessness was because of my curiosity, that I didn't realize I was dead inside.

My restlessness was because I never felt engaged with my life. Because I was dead inside, I couldn't feel satisfaction, so I jumped around looking for satisfaction anywhere I could.
I did what others wanted me to do because I was looking for approval. Because I was dead inside, I couldn't feel self-worth and craved external approval to compensate for my lack of self-esteem.
I put on a happy face because I was taught that expressing what I was really feeling was shameful. And so I became ashamed of my emotions and became dead inside.

But that's not the end of the story.

Because bodies and minds are designed to heal, and because of people who cared, I'm still here today.

And because I'm still here today, I can tell you that healing is possible, and feeling (again) is possible.

And I am filled with gratitude that I am now very much alive inside.
