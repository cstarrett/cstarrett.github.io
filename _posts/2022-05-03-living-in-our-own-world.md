Every person is a world. We each walk around with our own version of reality. What I see and hear is not the same as what you see and hear. We each have a perspective that is shaped by genetics, personality, and how we were raised. And there is no way for me to see and hear what is in your head, unless you tell me.

And yet, it's almost impossible to get any work done unless we can agree on reality. We need to know where we're starting from, if we're going to be able to get anywhere together.

This is one reason that honest conversation, and listening with curiosity, compassion, and courage is so essential to teamwork. It's such kind conversation that allows us to start aligning the worlds in our heads, until we are standing in the same place, looking at the same goal, and ready to take that first step in the right direction, together.
