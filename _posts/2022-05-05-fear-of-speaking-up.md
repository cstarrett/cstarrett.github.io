When we notice something isn't right, but don't say anything, nine times out of ten it's because of fear.

This is human, natural, and irresponsible.

Along with the awareness that something isn't right, comes the responsibility to call it out. To shine a light on it. To make those involved aware of what we see, so that you can see it together and act together to make it right.

So what can we do when we fail to speak up? Look inside.

Investigate the fear, starting with self-compassion (because this fear is human and natural). Get to know the fear. Not the story of the fear, but the feeling of the fear.

Because just like breaking in a pair of shoes, the more we allow ourselves to experience the fear in a grounded way — walking with it — the more comfortable we become with it. Until we find that when it's time to speak up, and we feel the fear, we can speak up anyway.
