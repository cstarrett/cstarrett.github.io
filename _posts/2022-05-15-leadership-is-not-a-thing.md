If we want to learn to ride a bike, it takes more than reading books, watching videos, or going to workshops. We need the courage to get on a bike to ride, fall, and ride again.

It takes practice, commitment, and just as importantly, a bike and enough space to ride in.

The same is true of leadership. Just like riding a bike, leadership is a skill. And it takes more than reading books, watching videos, or going to workshops to become better at leading. We need the courage to practice together with other people in a safe enough space where we can lead, fail, and get back up.

Leadership is not a thing we can have, but a skill we can develop, if we have the courage and commitment to practice.
