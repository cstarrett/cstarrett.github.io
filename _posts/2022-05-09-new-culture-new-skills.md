Culture is the way of being of an organization. The action and words of each member of an organization come out of that way of being and express the culture.

So changing the culture of an organization requires more than working groups and wordsmithing. It requires building new skills and capacity for this new way of being.

And building new skills and capacity takes time, attention, and practice.

All of this means that changing culture is not for the faint of heart. It's a commitment to a being a better organization which makes better things.

It's worth it, but only if you're in it for the long haul.
