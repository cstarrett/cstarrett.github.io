Each of us is right in our own head. That's why so many arguments don't go anywhere.

I'm right. And so are you.

What if instead of arguing about this, we started by agreeing that we're both right. And then compared notes.

How am I right? (What do I see?) How are you right? (What do you see?)

Listening with curiosity and empathy to what each of us sees, can we build a shared understanding? A shared map of the world we both live in? Can we see together something that neither of us could see alone?

And then from that shared understanding, sense what shared action we also see.

When we "agree to disagree," it's a cop-out. A way to avoid really listening to each other.

But when we agree to listen to each other without trying to change each other, real possibilities for collaboration can emerge.
