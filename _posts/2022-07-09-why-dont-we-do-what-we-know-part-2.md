Doing anything new takes time, attention, dedication, and practice.

You can't learn to play the piano by watching YouTube videos. You can't learn to speak French by reading a textbook. And reading the latest business book won't help your career or your business.

The only way to get better at something is by *doing* it. Spending time, attention, and dedication at the piano keyboard. Creating opportunities to converse in French. And finding small ways to practice over and over again the recommendations in that business book.

To make this process easier, build a cohort: people to play music with, regular French conversation partners, or a small group at work who are dedicated to making things better together.

There are no shortcuts to making change, and nobody is going to do it for you. Change happens when you show up, and do the work.
