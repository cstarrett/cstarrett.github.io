There are many forces that keep us stuck in our old ways of living and working, even when we know we want to change.

One of these forces is the people around us who expect us to keep acting the same way we always have. Some will be pleasantly surprised when we start to act more true to ourselves, but others won’t want us to change.

They may feel surprised, frustrated, confused, betrayed, and even angry if we break out of our old patterns, and start acting more true to who we really are.

Sometimes we need to make the hard decision to disappoint someone else, so that we can stop disappointing ourselves. That's easier said than done, but we have to do it if we're serious about our own growth.

And when the fear of disappointing others threatens to stop us from doing the right thing, we can keep going by remembering the wise words of Dr. Seuss: “Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind.”
