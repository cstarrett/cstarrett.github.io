title:  "Clearing out the little stresses"

Traffic is stressful. Writing emails is stressful. Meetings are stressful. Conversations can be stressful, too.

It's not that any of these things are big stresses, but little stresses. Little stresses that can pile up in the body.

We can't avoid stress, but we can take moments throughout the day to check in with the body and feel these little stresses.

The little stresses might show up as tension in the shoulders, or tightness in the belly. They might shift the way we sit in the chair, or the way we're breathing.

Take a moment to notice where stress is living in the body, and see if you can calm and ease the body. To get it back to a more relaxed state.

Feeling the body's weight on the seat, or on the feet. Feeling a strong back, and a soft, open front.

Letting the body just be for a moment, for one, slow breath, before getting back to work.

Stress is a natural part of life, but that doesn't mean we have to let it pile up in the body. Like brushing our teeth, we can make relaxing the body a regular hygiene practice, and notice if we feel any different at the end of the day.
