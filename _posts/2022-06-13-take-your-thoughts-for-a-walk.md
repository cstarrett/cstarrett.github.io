If you get caught in a loop with the same thoughts going around and around in your head, try taking your thoughts out for a walk.

This could be a literal walk outside, creating some space for the thoughts by bringing awareness to the feet touching the ground, and seeing the sky above.

This could be a walk on paper, where you let your thoughts go straight to your hand and into written words. Let the thoughts spread out and travel to where they want to go without censoring. Write whatever comes out. Nobody will see this but you.

Or you could draw your thoughts, letting them walk in lines around the paper. What colors, shapes, or textures appear from your hand?

Sometimes the head is too small a space for our thoughts so they spin around and around like a dog chasing its tail. Notice what happens if you let your thoughts out from between your ears and give them some space to roam.
