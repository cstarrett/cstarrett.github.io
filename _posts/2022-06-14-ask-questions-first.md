Have you ever had someone "help" you in a way that wasn't helpful? When someone jumped in as a "knight in shining armor" to "save" you, just to do something for you that maybe even made things worse?

The step they probably skipped was to have a conversation first.

To sit down with you and create space for you to reflect on and share what you're struggling with. Not only to listen, but also ask questions that could help *you* uncover what would really serve you best right now.

We may think we need introductions to clients, but what we really need is help with our communications. We may think we need help with a plan, but what we really need is help in getting clearer on our intention. We may think we need help in getting more done, but what we really need is help in how to do less.

As social animals, often the first, best way we can help each other is to ask good questions, and to listen, so we can uncover what we really need in this moment.

And *then* act together from that place of shared understanding.
