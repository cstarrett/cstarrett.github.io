The bottom line on the balance sheet often implies profit. But what is the profit for?

Is the purpose of your work purely to make money, or are you trying to make a difference in the world? Does your enjoyment at work come from only from how much you're earning, or does it come from tackling new challenges, growing your skills, or the camaraderie of working together with people who you care about?

There's no right or wrong answer here, but it's important to be clear whether you do what you do purely to make money, or if you're making money to support what you do. Knowing your real bottom line will tell you where to focus your attention to do your best work.
