Why is a clear intention so powerful? Because it unlocks at least three "must-haves" for success:

(1) Opportunity. There are a near-infinite number of opportunities within our reach all the time. The challenge is in seeing the opportunity we need. Intention acts as a kind of filter, helping us to ignore distractions and see more clearly the opportunity we need that is right in front of us.

(2) Motivation. Most of us have many demands on our attention all the time â€” demands that may all align with our desires and values, but which will keep us running in circles. Intention gives our attention focus and keeps us pointed in the right direction: towards the one thing that matters most to us in this moment.

(3) Partnership. The solo, heroic leader is a myth. None of us can accomplish anything alone. At the same time, just getting a bunch of people together, however well-meaning they may be, is a recipe for chaos. Shared action can only come from shared intention, focusing everyone's attention in the same direction to see the opportunity that is ready and waiting for the group.

What is your intention for your work? Who could you share it with, to start building a shared intention for shared action?
