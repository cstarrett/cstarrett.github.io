It's often said that insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting a different result. Luckily, humans are a very adaptable species.

Take opening a jar, for example. If we try to twist the top off, and it doesn't come off, we try other ways. Maybe we use something that gives us a better grip. Maybe we run the top under hot water to get it to expand a bit. Or we might just ask for help from someone who is stronger than we are.

So if you're not getting the desired results, maybe the answer isn't trying to do better or faster the same thing you've always done. Maybe the answer is doing something different.

Maybe "this is the way we do things" is exactly the problem.
