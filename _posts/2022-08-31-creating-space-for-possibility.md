For future possibility to show up, it needs space, emptiness, not-knowing, or some uncertainty about the present.

If you've decided that you must fly to Texas for a conference, then there is no possibility to do something else. If you feel you have no choice but to do that project with your brother-in-law, then there's no possibility to say "no." And if you're convinced that the only job you're qualified for is the one you're doing, then you're stuck.

The step before seeing possibilities for the future is to see our present situation more clearly. Why must I fly to Texas for that conference? Can I endure the discomfort of even thinking about saying "no" to my brother-in-law? And is it really true that I'm not qualified for any other job?

If we can create even one, small alternative to our situation, then we create a space where more possibilities and choices could arise.

What if I were too sick to travel? What if I found someone else to work with my brother-in-law? What if I a magic fairy paid me to do something I currently do for fun?

None of these possibilities may come true, but when we can imagine one path out of our current situation, it makes it easier to imagine more. And as we imagine more, there is the possibility to envision a step we *can* take from where we are that starts to lead us somewhere new.

Nothing in nature stays the same, and that includes us. Change is natural. Sometimes when we're stuck, we just need to find a way to give ourselves a little nudge to get ourselves moving again.

How do you nudge yourself when you get stuck? Feel free to share so we can all learn from each other!
