What did you have for breakfast this morning? Why did you have that?

Is it because it was fast? Or maybe something you felt like eating? Was it the only thing available? Or did you eat the same thing you always eat out of convenience? (That was my reason, by the way.)

How often do we stop to really think about how much of our lives are on autopilot? What would happen if we became more aware of the reasons why we do what we do?

And when we think we know why, what would happen if we stopped to ask ourselves, "Is that true?" Is the reason why we did that, "Because my boss asked me to," or is it, "Because I don't want to disappoint my boss." In other words, is there another reason under what we *think* is the reason why we do what we do. And what is underneath, "Because I don't want to disappoint my boss." Is it respect for our boss? Or fear that we'll lose our job? Or a desire for better standing in the organization?

This can become a lot of fun when we can develop the skill to see all the reasons why we do what we do, *without judging* the reason. Just let it be okay that we feel afraid, or ambitious, or that we like the comfort of routine.

Because when we judge, we have a tendency to not want to see the truth of what is there. And it makes the whole exercise of asking "Is that true?" a lot less fun.
