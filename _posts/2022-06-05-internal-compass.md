When we feel that the life we're living and the work we're doing is not really ours, it can be like a shirt we've outgrown and has some holes, but we've gotten used to. We have to face the question of, "If not this shirt, then what?" Even more daunting can be the prospect of taking the shirt off, being naked, and then putting on another that may or may not be the right one either.

The devil we know can be better than the devil we don't.

And to find a new shirt that fits who we are, both inside and outside, we need to have a sense of how we would feel in that kind of shirt, and we have to go out and look for it.

Similarly, there are two parts to finding the work and life which is ours. One is that we have to go out and experiment so we have a chance to encounter something that fits us better, and the other is that we have to have the ability recognize the fit.

*(Having the courage to take the leap of enacting the change is for another post. This is just about the search.)*

There are a lot of opportunities through volunteer work, social events, as well as books, blogs, podcasts, and videos, to experience directly, or through others, all manner of work and ways of living.

The hard part is knowing what is ours.

After spending a lifetime (so far) being and working as someone who is not quite *ourselves,* it can be hard to discern what really resonates with our core, and what doesn't. In order to survive in a world that expects us to be who they want us to be, rather than who we are, many of us shut off that part of us that yearns for the life and work which is ours. We had to ignore that calling so that we could keep doing what we were expected to do.

The ability to *re-cognize,* or know again, that which is ours is still within us, but it's out of practice, and maybe we feel a bit uncertain whether it's safe to start using it again. Just like bedridden people whose legs have atrophied need physical therapy to build the strength, coordination, and confidence to walk again, we need to gently practice *re-membering* that part of us which once knew what was ours.

Noticing what draws our attention and then pausing to ask ourselves, is that attraction coming from me, or is it something someone told me I should like? When I notice a particular feeling, or impulse, asking myself where that is coming from? Is it a habit I learned in order to comply, or is it coming from somewhere deeper in me?

And if I don't know the answer, that's okay. What's important is that I take the time, each time, to ask the question. To start to shed the wants and ways of being that I learned from elsewhere, so that I can see the source more clearly, of who I am, and what is my work.

Take your time. Be gentle. Celebrate the small wins. Fix your gaze on living a life which is yours. And keep going.
