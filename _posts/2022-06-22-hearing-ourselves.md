"The answer is inside you."

That old chestnut of coaching advice is incredibly frustrating if we don't know where to look inside ourselves for that answer. The answer may as well be halfway around the world. What good does it do having it inside me, if I can't find it anyway.

This is why we need people to ask us questions, especially the questions we wouldn't think to ask. So we can hear ourselves answering these unexpected or maybe "obvious" questions (so obvious that we wouldn't think of them), and then hearing ourselves give the answer that we've been looking for.

Having a real human being ask us in real time is part of the magic, too, because we say things differently to another human being, than we would say to ourselves.

Yes, the answer we need is very often inside of us. But the question we need in order to find the answer may be in someone else. 

Who do you know who could ask you the questions you wouldn't think to ask, and create time and space for you to hear yourself answer?
