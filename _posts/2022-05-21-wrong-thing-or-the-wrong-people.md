If you discover that you are caring more than the people you serve, then either youâ€™re caring about the wrong thing or serving the wrong people.

You're caring about the wrong thing, because what you are caring about is not what the people you serve are caring about.

Or, if you don't want to change what you care about, then you need to find people to serve who care about what you care about.

Either way, caring more than the people who you serve is is not serving anyone.
