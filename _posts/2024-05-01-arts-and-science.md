It always seems like the first thing to get cut in any school is the arts.

After all, we need to preparqe kids for their future, and there's no future in the arts. Kids need to learn practical skills. Things that will help them to get a job. To make a living. To be successful in life.

But what future is in store for our kids? Climate anxiety? Growing income inequality? Never-ending war?

With so many ongoing crises we need the arts more than ever. We need to remember what it means to be human. Why the continued survival of our species matters. What our strengths are as humans: our imagination, our compassion, and our ability to work together.

Individually, humans are relatively weak in the animal kingdom. But through collective action, we have risen to a dominant position in the Earth's ecosystem.

The arts remind us of what matters most, remind us of who we are, and help to keep hope alive so that we can keep going and find a way through the current crises.

If we really want to prepare our kids for the future, and prepare the future for our kids, we can't lose sight of the arts, and the artists, holding up a mirror to remind us and challenge us to keep going.
