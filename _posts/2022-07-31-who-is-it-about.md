When someone comes to us with a problem, how often do we jump to give advice?

Even if the person says they want us to tell them what to do, is that how we can best help?

Are we giving advice so we feel smart, or helpful, or to get the conversation over with so we can get to something else? Is our giving advice about how we want to feel about ourselves, or about our own agenda?

Are we giving advice because they asked us to and we want to be a good friend, boss, or sibling?

What if instead of giving advice, we gave time and attention? What if we asked questions? What if we simply shared what we see, without trying to influence them? Just bringing another perspective that they may not have realized?

Holding an agenda-less space with someone isn't easy. It takes discipline and practice to quiet our own ego and not tell the other person what to do. But there is a magic in creating the conditions for the other person to come to their own insights, and their own conclusion about the best next step.

Because when the person can own what they see and feel as theirs, they can own their actions as well. And motivation to action that comes from inside ourselves, is the most lasting and resilient motivation of all.
