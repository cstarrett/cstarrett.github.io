title:  "What does it mean to be enough?"

How much is enough? How many certifications are enough? How many promotions are enough? How much money is enough? How many friends are enough? How much prestige is enough? How much fame is enough?

What happens once we have enough and we do enough? Is it only then that we can finally be enough? Is it only then that we are worthy of love and respect? That we are a human being who matters?

What if we are already worthy of love and respect just because we are human? What if we already matter because we are part of nature? Because we belong to the Earth's ecosystem, and every part matters, including us?

If we are already worthy of love and respect, if we already matter, and if we already belong, then maybe that's enough. Maybe what we do is a contribution from our generosity and gratitude for being part of humanity, part of nature, and part of the Earth?

If we already do enough, we already have enough, and we already are enough, what comes next?

That's the question.
