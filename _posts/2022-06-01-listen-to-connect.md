If I talk to you and you don't listen, there's no connection. And I can't *make* you listen, either.

So the only way for *me* to ensure that there's connection is if I let you talk, and I listen. 

If we are serious about wanting to connect with another person, we must put our own agenda aside and listen with curiosity, courage, and compassion. We may not like what we hear, but if we can accept it  is true for the other person, even if we don't agree with it, then we have a chance of making a connection.

And with connection comes a chance of authentic communication, and even collaboration on making a change that matters, together.

And it starts with listening.
