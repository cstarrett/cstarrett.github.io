If you asked my middle school science teacher how long a meter was, he'd hold out his hands a meter apart and say "about this long."

His point was that he didn't believe in learning the metric system of measurement by comparing it to the imperial system that we used in the United States. He wanted us to learn it as an independent system. We should feel the weight of a kilogram, measure with rulers in centimeters, and weigh a cubic centimeter of water and see that it was one gram.

He wanted us to get a fresh sense of the world directly measured in the metric system, rather than converting everything from our past experience, which will inevitably result in an approximation.

It's natural for us to compare and contrast new experiences and acquaintances with those we've had in the past. This person's voice reminds us of someone from a previous job, or this restaurant is noisier than that other one we were at. When we compare and contrast it helps us to share our sense of the world with each other.

The downside is that it also reduces our present moment experience by putting more attention on things we can relate to past experience.

What happens when you try describing a situation or the person in its own terms along with how you feel about it, without comparing or contrasting. What aspects seem most important? What do you notice about them?

For instance, notice how it feels to say, "This food feels comforting," without giving a reason. Without saying what else it tastes like, or what it reminds you of. Just enjoying and sharing the fact that it feels comforting to eat.

It can be the same when enjoying a sunset with someone, or a concert, the satisfaction of finishing a project. How might it feel to simply fully experience this moment as it is, without comparing it to any other time, person, place, or thing?

Comparing and contrasting is a very useful skill. But so is our ability to come to each moment with a beginner's mind, and sense everything fresh.

What do you feel or sense in this moment, when you bring your attention to it, as if for the first time?
