A tale of two emails

Yesterday we received an email from a potential business partner that we knew he wrote from the heart. We could feel his enthusiasm, sincerity, and presence in the words. It wasn't perfect or polished, but it didn't matter. We felt seen and cared about, and were grateful to experience his human-to-human professionalism through the text.

Today we received an email from another potential business partner. This email could have written to anybody. It was the archetype of the modern form letter, complete with "hip" language that he has never used with us in person, probably because of our age. (My using the term "hip language" should give you a clue of how old I am.) It felt mechanical, unfeeling, and unprofessional.

The words in the second email appear more intimate and personal, but the lack of caring they communicated left us cold. The words in the first email were more professional and focused on business, but the caring they communicated felt warm.

All the tips and tricks in the world on "business communication" won't help you, if you don't know how to connect with what you care about in the relationship. Businesses are built on relationships. And relationships are built on caring.
