Helping the listener to hear is an underrated skill.

As speakers, we can start with choosing words that are easy to understand. Regular pauses allow the listener to digest what has been said. Using vocal techniques to vary the delivery makes a long talk less tiring to listen to, and selective emphasis helps the listener to understand what the most important points are that you would like them to remember.

Most of all, knowing who your audience is and what is important to them will help you know what to say and how to say it.

It's *presencing* — being present *with* your audience —  rather than *presenting* — talking *at* your audience.

At the end of the day, we want to be heard. So why not help our listeners to hear us?
