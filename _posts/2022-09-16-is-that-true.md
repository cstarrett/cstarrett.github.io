What's the harm in asking?

Maybe it is true, and maybe it's not.

We make so many assumptions just to get through daily life, often without ever realizing it, and sometimes those assumptions steer us the wrong way. So it's worth asking, "Is that true?" 

This isn't because we know that it's not true, but just to wonder. To notice the difference between an assumption and knowledge we feel confident in. And to create a space for another perspective or a more complete view.

"Is that true?" What do you feel with that question? Curiosity? Or maybe defensiveness, or even anger?

If strong feelings come up with that question, where is that coming from? Is there a danger you sense with that question? A threat that you fear?

If so, it might be useful to look at that perceived threat and ask again, "Is that threat true?"

Because if that threat isn't true, then congratulations! You've just won yourself a little more freedom from fear.

So the next time you find yourself certain of something, it might be worth asking yourself, "Is that true?" and see where that question leads!
