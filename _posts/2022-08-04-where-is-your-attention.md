If you're worrying about getting it done, then you're worrying. You're not getting it done.

If you're complaining about your job, then you're complaining. You're neither learning more about what's not working, nor are you doing anything to create a better situation for yourself.

If you're frustrated by not being able to make a decision, then you're focusing on not being able to decide, not on finding more clarity so that you can decide.

All of these are natural states that we fall into from time-to-time. The invitation is to notice when we're stuck and ask ourselves where our attention is. If our attention is stuck on feeling bad about the situation, can we apply some compassion towards how we feel, and gently bring our attention back to what matters most â€” finding a way through the current situation?

Action follows attention, which is why knowing where our attention is in each moment is key to getting unstuck.
