If you feel scared to step into the unknown, that's normal. Our bodies are wired to stay safe, so alarms go off when we know we're taking a risk; when we're about to do something where the outcome is uncertain.

Of course if you're even thinking of stepping into the unknown, it's probably because for some reason, staying safe doesn't feel right anymore. Because you know that you have to move from where you are and venture out in a new direction. Maybe the thought is even exciting, but fear can still hold us back.

One thing that can help us to venture out even with this fear is being part of a community of like-hearted adventurers. A community of people who have each others' back. People who don't feel threatened by our leaving the status quo. People who are there to listen as we explore possibilities, navigate challenges, and work through fears. Maybe even people who can encourage us to keep going when things get really tough.

Like in a caravan crossing the desert, the ultimate destinations of the members of this community may all be different, but we can come together for a while to cross the more uncertain and uncharted terrain as a group.

Leaving the certainty of what is familiar to venture into the unknown is hard enough already. If possible, don't try to do it alone. Find a community you can trust. There's more safety in numbers.
