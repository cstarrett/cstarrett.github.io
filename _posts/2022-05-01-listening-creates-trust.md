When we listen, we have the opportunity to create trust.

Trust that we care enough to spend time on strengthening this relationship. To put aside our ego, opinions, and biases and see things from another perspective. To allow ourselves be changed by a conversation.

But this requires more than not talking. To build trust, we need to give our full, open attention to the other person. This is a skill.

And every conversation we have is an opportunity to practice that skill, and to create trust, if we choose to.
