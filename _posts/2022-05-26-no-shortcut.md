That's the uncomfortable truth.

To do anything well takes skill that comes from practice. And practice takes time.

Although some approaches to practice are more effective than others, even the best practice regimen still takes time.

And the time spent on looking for shortcuts would be better spent practicing. Because eventually, that's where you will end up if you're serious about what you want to do. So you may as well start now.
