Every one of us is a world. We each walk around with a unique version of the world in our heads.

So when we really listen to another person with an open mind and an open heart, we risk being changed. We risk that what we hear will shift something in us so that we never see, think, or feel quite the same way again.

This means we may learn that what we thought we knew is wrong. Or that we are not showing up as the person we thought we were.

So it takes courage to really listen to another person.

Because before you can really listen, you have to be willing to be changed by what you hear.
