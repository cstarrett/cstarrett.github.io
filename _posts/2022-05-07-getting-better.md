My piano teacher once told me there were three steps to becoming a better musician:
1. Practice
2. Practice
3. Practice

This is true for anything we want to get better at. Want to be a better speaker? Practice. Want to be a better listener? Practice. Want to become better at noticing your emotions before they get out of hand? Practice.

It takes commitment and consistent practice to get better at any skill. Which means creating lots of time and opportunities to practice, either on your own, or with others. Preferably when the stakes are low so you can push your edges, and learn from your mistakes without much consequence.

So the next time you're tempted to spend time looking for new techniques, tips, or tricks, stop and use the time to practice the ones you know already instead.

You can thank me later.
