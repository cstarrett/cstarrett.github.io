title: Skills for not fitting in

In Stop Stealing Dreams, Seth Godin wrote about the origin and reality of our predominant work culture, and why it's not working for us anymore. And more importantly, he shows how our current education system is designed around shaping us to fit in and succeed as standardized human units in the current system.

But some of us don’t fit in, and don’t want to fit into a standardized system. We see possibilities for working together where we can contribute according to our strengths. We see a new paradigm of work that is life-giving and serving people and the planet, rather than soul-sucking and depleting workers and the Earth.

A new paradigm that doesn't exist, and won't exist until those of us who are holding the seeds inside ourselves leave the standardized system and set out to create it. But how?

We need to learn new skills together for working without a manual, without structure, without guarantees, which is really hard, especially for those of us who enjoyed being rewarded in school and at work. No more rules or norms to fall back on. No railings to lean on for security. No paths to follow for success.

We need to learn how to find our way in the wild: bushwhacking, orienteering without a map, searching for sustenance and safe shelter as we go.

Someday there may be a new paradigm of working and living with wholeness and a new education system which teaches the skills and knowledge we need to operate within it. But what we need now are the inner skills we didn't learn in school — skills for finding our way out of the current paradigm, and for building something new together where we can all thrive by being exactly who we are.
