People are behind every decision to buy. Even if you do business-to-business sales, and even if a company is paying for your product, the decision to buy was made by people. Human beings with human needs, wants, fears, and aspirations.

Of course you want to sell something you can be proud of. A product you can stand behind.

But it's not all about the specifications and the value *you see* in your product.

It's about the person who is deciding to buy it, or not.

What are *their* needs, wants, fears, and aspiration? What do they believe? (It's very likely *not* the same as what you believe.)

To make a sale is to make a connection â€” human to human. And to do that you need to know as much about the *person* you are selling to, as you do about what you are selling.
