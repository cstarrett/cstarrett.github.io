If you're a human, then I'm willing to bet that at least part of your business involves people. And, because you're in a people business, you may find it difficult to explain what makes the human part of your business special.

How is working with you different from working with other people? What do your clients and customers feel when they work with you?

No matter how many testimonials we have, it's difficult to communicate the *experience* of working with us when all we have are words on a page. Maybe it would be better if we didn't try.

Instead, find ways to show a potential customer what it might feel like to work with you. Create invitations for them to experience you in a webinar, through a video, or a podcast. Let them hear your voice, sense your personality, and feel for themselves if they would enjoy working together.

We really can't tell someone whether we're a good match. The best we can do is show who we are, and let them decide for themselves.
