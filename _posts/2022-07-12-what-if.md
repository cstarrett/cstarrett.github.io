What if we didn't try to be right, but we tried to learn?

What if I saw my win as your win, and your loss as my loss?

What if we valued listening as much as talking?

What if asking for a pause to let difficult emotions settle was the norm?

What if we remembered that we're all breathing the same air, drinking the same water, and walking on the same planet?

What if we saw how none of us are free, unless all of us are?
