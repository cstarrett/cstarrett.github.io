# Curiosity and fear

Fear can expand to contol our thoughts, our feelings, and our actions. It has the ability to block everything else out of our awareness.

And resistance is futile. It will counter any argument we bring and laugh at any attempt to put a silver lining on it.

Curiosity is its Kryptonite. Curisotiy and fear cannot co-exist. Fear is the force that layers us in armor and locks the doors to keep us safe. Curiostiy is what pulls us ouside and opens our eyes and hearts wide to see and feel what is there.

If we can find a way to be even a little bit curious when we feel afraid, it makes a crack through which we can find our courage again.
